# (WIP) Python library for Classification portal

This Python library lets you call public API of the Classification portal (at FIT, CTU) and work with it from your Python programs. It is a coursework for MI-PYT subject.

## Key features
* Login with your FIT credentials (the concrete way of authorizing yourself will be decided on later)
* Work with API through Python methods and objects

### Additional things
* The code will be covered with tests
* A documentation will be created (in English)
* The library will be packaged as a Python module (and, maybe, even deployed to PyPI)
